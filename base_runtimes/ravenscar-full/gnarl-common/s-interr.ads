--  This is the Ravenscar version of this package

--  Note: the compiler generates direct calls to this interface, via Rtsfind.
--  Any changes to this interface may require corresponding compiler changes.

--  This package encapsulates the implementation of interrupt or signal
--  handlers. It is logically an extension of the body of Ada.Interrupts.
--  It is made a child of System to allow visibility of various
--  runtime system internal data and operations.
