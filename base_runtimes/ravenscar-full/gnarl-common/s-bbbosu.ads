   --  This type represents any interval that we can measure within a
   --  Clock_Interrupt_Period. Even though this type is always 32 bits, its
   --  actual allowed range is 0 .. Max_Timer_Interval, which may be less,
   --  depending on the target.

   function Max_Timer_Interval return Timer_Interval;

   --  The maximum value of the hardware clock. The is the maximum value that

   --  The hardware clock period is Max_Timer_Interval + 1 clock ticks. An
   --  interrupt occurs after this number of ticks.

   procedure Set_Alarm (Ticks : Timer_Interval);
   --  Set an alarm that will expire after the specified number of clock ticks.
   --  This cancels any previous alarm set.

   function Read_Clock return Timer_Interval;

   --  interrupt to handle for the given trap vector. If the trap does not
   --  correspond to an external interrupt (that is, if it is a synchronous
   --  trap) then interrupt level 0 (no interrupt) is returned.  If the
   --  system shares a single trap handler for multiple external interrupts,
   --  this would typically query the interrupt controller for determining
   --  the interrupt to handle.

   --  vector, though this procedure may be called for multiple interrupts
   --  that share the same vector, as long as they use the same Handler.
   --  The handler expects a single argument indicating the vector called.
   --  This routine may need to set up the interrupt controller to enable the
   --  given interrupt source, so it will actually cause a trap on the CPU.
   --  Note, this should not actually enable interrupts, as this is only done
   --  through CPU_Primitives.Enable_Interrupts, which typically uses a
   --  processor status register. Prio is the priority for the interrupt, and
   --  the hardware can be programmed to use that priority.

   --  Only allow interrupts higher than the specified priority. This routine
   --  differes from the Enable_Interrupts/Disable_Interrupts procedures
   --  in CPU_Primitives in that it disables interrupts at the board level,
   --  rather than the CPU. Typically if board-specific support of an interrupt
   --  controller is needed to block interrupts of insufficient priority, this
   --  routine will be needed. On other systems, where the processor has this
   --  control, or where only a single interrupt priority is supported, this
   --  may be a null procedure.
