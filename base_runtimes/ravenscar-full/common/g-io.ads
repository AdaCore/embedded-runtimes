--  A simple preelaborable subset of Text_IO capabilities

--  A simple text I/O package that can be used for simple I/O functions in
--  user programs as required. This package is also preelaborated, unlike
--  Text_IO, and can thus be with'ed by preelaborated library units.

--  Note that Data_Error is not raised by these subprograms for bad data.
--  If such checks are needed then the regular Text_IO package must be used.

--  This is the zfp version of GNAT.IO package

package GNAT.IO is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   procedure Put (X : Integer);
   --  Output integer to specified file, or to current output file, same
   --  output as if Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO had been instantiated for Integer.

   procedure Put (C : Character);
   --  Output character to specified file, or to current output file

   procedure Put (S : String);
   --  Output string to specified file, or to current output file

   procedure Put_Line (S : String);
   --  Output string followed by new line to specified file, or to
   --  current output file.

   procedure New_Line (Spacing : Positive := 1);
   --  Output new line character to specified file, or to current output file

end GNAT.IO;
