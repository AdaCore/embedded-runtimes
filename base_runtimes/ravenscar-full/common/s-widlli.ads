--  This package contains the routine used for Width attribute for all
--  non-static signed integer subtypes. Note we only have one routine,
--  since this seems a fairly marginal function.

package System.Wid_LLI is
   pragma Pure;

   function Width_Long_Long_Integer
     (Lo, Hi : Long_Long_Integer)
      return   Natural;
   --  Compute Width attribute for non-static type derived from a signed
   --  Integer type. The arguments Lo, Hi are the bounds of the type.

end System.Wid_LLI;
