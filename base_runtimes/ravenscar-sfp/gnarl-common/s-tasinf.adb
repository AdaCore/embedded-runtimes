--  This is a dummy version of this package that is needed to solve bootstrap
--  problems when compiling a library that doesn't require s-tasinf.adb from
--  a compiler that contains one.

--  This package contains the definitions and routines associated with the
--  implementation of the Task_Info pragma.
